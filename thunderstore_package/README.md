# OoT Mirror Shield for Majora's Mask in Zelda 64 Recompiled
This mod replaces the mirror shield with the OoT version. You can switch between the N64 and the GC/Wii/3DS designs, as well as change the border color with an RGB selector. Optional HD textures included (recommended only if you're playing with an HD texture pack).
