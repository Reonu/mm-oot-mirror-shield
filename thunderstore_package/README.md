- EPIC SUNGLASSES that replace the Blast Mask's model

![EPIC sunglasses. Don't like them? Too bad. He doesn't care. He WILL dab on you.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Reonu/mm-dab-mod/refs/heads/main/page_assets/sunglasses.png)

### Notes:
- Link is invulnerable while dabbing (the explosion won't damage him). This is intentional.
